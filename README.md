## Installation

### Clone the repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### Install dependencies
Ensure that you have `bundler` installed:

```bash
gem install bundler
```

Then install the required gems:

```bash
bundle install
```

### Add HTML, CSS, and JS Files
All the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files needed to build the site are located in the respective directories of the project:

- **`index.html`**: This is the main HTML file for the site.
- **`/css/`**: This folder contains custom stylesheets.
- **`/js/`**: This folder contains JavaScript files for interactivity.

## Usage

### Running Locally
To preview the site locally before pushing changes to GitHub Pages, run the following command:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000` to view the site.

### Hosting on GitHub Pages
Once the site is ready, simply push your changes to the `main` (or `gh-pages`) branch on GitHub. GitHub Pages will automatically detect the Jekyll configuration and deploy the site.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

The site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name`

## Jekyll Workflow Setup

To host the site using GitHub Pages and Jekyll, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have a valid `Gemfile` at the root of your project that includes the Jekyll gem:

    ```ruby
    source "https://rubygems.org"
    gem "jekyll", "~> 4.2.0"
    ```

2. Create a `.github/workflows/jekyll.yml` file to automate the deployment process with GitHub Actions:

    ```yaml
    name: Jekyll Site CI

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
        - name: Checkout Code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2

        - name: Setup Ruby
          uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
          with:
            ruby-version: '2.7'

        - name: Install Jekyll and Bundler
          run: |
            gem install bundler
            bundle install

        - name: Build Site
          run: bundle exec jekyll build

        - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
          uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
          with:
            github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            publish_dir: ./_site
    ```

3. Ensure that you have a `_config.yml` file at the root of the project that configures Jekyll and your site preferences.

4. Push all changes to the GitHub repository, and GitHub Actions will automatically run the workflow to build and deploy the site.
